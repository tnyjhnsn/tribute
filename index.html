        <p><span class="dropcap "><strong>T</strong></span>wo roads diverged in a yellow wood,
          <br />And sorry I could not travel both
          <br />And be one traveler, long I stood
          <br />And looked down one as far as I could
          <br />To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
        <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
          <br />And having perhaps the better claim,
          <br />Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
          <br />Though as for that the passing there
          <br />Had worn them really about the same,</p>
        <p>And both that morning equally lay
          <br />In leaves no step had trodden black.
          <br />Oh, I kept the first for another day!
          <br />Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
          <br />I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
        <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
          <br />Somewhere ages and ages hence:
          <br />Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
          <br />I took the one less traveled by,
          <br />And that has made all the difference.
